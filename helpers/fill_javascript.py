'''
This script uses the configurations provided by the user and fills out 
template javascript files.  The completed file is then used for the front end

Note that it looks in the $APP_ROOT/static/ directory (skipping admin dir), which means you need
to run python3 manage.py collectstatic prior to this.

This also assumes that any variables you define in your template MUST BE DEFINED
in config/general.cfg

For instance, if the js file has {{foo}}, then your config file must contain:
...
FOO=Bar
...

in one of the sections of general.cfg.  Note that when configparser reads the variables
from the config file, it lowers them, so the key "FOO" above becomes "foo".  The variables
are case-sensitive, so {{foo}} would be replaced by "Bar"
