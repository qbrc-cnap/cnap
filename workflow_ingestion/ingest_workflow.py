'''
This script is used for incorporating new analysis workflows into the
the framework.

Users will start with a directory containing a WORKING docker-based
WDL workflow

We require that there is only one WDL file (ending with ".wdl").  
If additional WDL files are used to define the sub-tasks (or sub-workflows)
then they need to be zipped.  Zipping is required to submit to the Cromwell
engine regardless.
